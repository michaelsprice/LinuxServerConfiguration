# Linux Server Configuration Project

Clicking on a category will show you a list of items associated to that Category. Clicking on the item will show the item and the description. From there, you can edit or delete the item.

- `sudo ufw default deny outgoing` (denies all outgoing requests)
- `sudo ufw allow 2200/tcp` (this will allow incoming SSH requests)
